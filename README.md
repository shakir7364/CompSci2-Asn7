# Computer Science II Assignment 7
This assignment is to write a Fraction class that contains a numerator and denominator. It also contains methods to calculate common fraction operations such as fraction simplification, finding greatest common divisor, switching sign, inversing a fraction, adding two fractions, subtracting two fractions, multiplying two fractions, deviding two fractions, change fraction to a double, change fraction to an int, change fraction to a percent, and change fraction to a mixed number. The class also contains methods to return number of fractions instantiated, override toString(), override clone(), and finalize() to decrement the number of Fraction objects instantiated.
